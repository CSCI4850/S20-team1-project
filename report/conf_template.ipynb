    "\\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)\n",
    "\\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).\n",
    "\\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.\n",
    "\\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.\n",
    "\\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.\n",
    "\\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.\n",
    "\\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.\n",
    "\\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.\n",
    "\\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.\n",
