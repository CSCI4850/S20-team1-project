PROJECT DEMO READ ME

To work on your Jupyter, first install opencv if you do not already have it installed.

Enter this command into your command line to do so.

	pip install opencv-python

Once installed, proceed to the Demo Predict ipynb.

From there, you can work with the network or check out the work we already have.
